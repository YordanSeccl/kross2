## Local Development

Clone this repository, and run `yarn` or `npm install` from the new folder to install all required dependencies.

Then start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Layouts

The template is based on small, content-agnostic partials that can be mixed and matched. The pre-built pages showcase just a few of the possible combinations. Refer to the `site/layouts/partials` folder for all available partials.

Use Hugo’s `dict` functionality to feed content into partials and avoid repeating yourself and creating discrepancies.

## CSS

The template uses a custom fork of Tachyons and PostCSS with cssnext and cssnano. Refer to `src/css/imports/_variables.css` where most of the important global variables like colors and spacing are stored.
