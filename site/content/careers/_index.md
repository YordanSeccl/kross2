        Some people don’t like ambiguity or change. Our people embrace it. It makes for an exciting, fast-paced environment, where ambiguity and challenge are embraced, not shied away from.

section3:
    heading: How we work
    subheading: Lots of companies have values. But we think it’s more useful to provide practical building blocks to guide the way we work, the people we hire, and the things we expect of ourselves and each other. They’re our operating principles – values, made real.

    - item:
      heading: Our mission
      subheading: To rebuild the infrastructure of investments and advice<br/><br/>Existing technology is inefficient, inflexible and unwieldy – powered by decades-old software and patched together by manual processes. It’s bad for business, and bad for people, too. That’s why we’re rebuilding it, from the ground up.
    - item:
      heading: Our vision
      subheading: To be the first choice for all investment and advice firms<br/><br/>We want to become an integral part of the investment and advice landscape, building a business that our customers recommend, and where colleagues love to work.
