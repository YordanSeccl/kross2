### Who are we?

At Seccl, we’re on a mission to rebuild the infrastructure of investments and advice. We provide the technology that allows people to access financial markets – buying and selling investments, and holding them in tax wrappers like ISAs and pensions.

Our software allows ambitious fintechs to quickly get to market with innovative investment or advice products – and helps financial advisers and investment managers to build stronger, more valuable businesses, by operating their own investment platform.

Ultimately, we want to create a world where everybody can access the financial markets, or find the help they need, more easily and affordably than ever.

We recently became part of the <a href="https://www.octopusgroup.com" target="blank">Octopus Group</a> – an innovative, £9bn+ group of companies that’s on a mission to breathe new life into energy and financial services, and improve the lives of millions of people.
