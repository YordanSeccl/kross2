### Who are we?

At Seccl, we’re on a mission to rebuild the infrastructure of investments and advice. We provide the technology that allows people to access financial markets – buying and selling investments, and holding them in tax wrappers like ISAs and pensions.

Our software allows ambitious fintechs to quickly get to market with innovative investment or advice products – and helps financial advisers and investment managers to build stronger, more valuable businesses, by operating their own investment platform.

Ultimately, we want to create a world where everybody can access the financial markets, or find the help they need, more easily and affordably than ever.

We recently became part of the <a href="https://www.octopusgroup.com" target="blank">Octopus Group</a> – an innovative, £9bn+ group of companies that’s on a mission to breathe new life into energy and financial services, and improve the lives of millions of people.

### How can you help?

We have a great opportunity for someone with previous business development or account management experience, preferably at a fast-growing fintech firm, to come and help us find our next generation of ambitious fintechs looking to transform the worlds of investing and financial advice.
You’ll help to identify and qualify new prospects from within the fintech and wealthtech communities, seek to understand their goals and objectives, then work with our Partner Launch team to get them set up on our service.

### What will you be doing?

On a day-to-day level, you’ll be…

*	Develop and own relationships with key communities and networks within the UK’s fintech space, with a view to building Seccl’s presence as the go-to solution for technology firms building new investment or advice propositions
*	Run the sales process and pipeline for fintech prospects
*	Work closely with our Partner Launch team to get won prospects to market
*	Generate insights and document market trends from within the fintech and wealthtech communities, that can steer future sales and marketing content/activity


### Who are we looking for? You’ll be someone who…

*	Able to grasp complex concepts quickly and explain them simply to others
*	Happy to hunt new business as well as deal with inbound leads
*	Buzzed by helping clients and always goes above and beyond to do so
*	Excited about working in a rapidly growing fintech with a steep learning curve
*	Passionate about the role of technology
*	A people person with strong communication skills. You’ll be able to easily build rapport, and adapt your style depending on the situation
*	Highly organised and able to keep multiple plates spinning
*	Confident, smiley and enjoys making customers feel totally taken care of
*	Proactive, resilient and comfortable with ambiguity. You’ll like working at pace and thinking on your feet
*	Empathetic, kind and with bags of innate integrity. You’ll do the right thing, even when no-one’s watching


### How do we work?

We’re a team of ambitious, talented, and creative people who are passionate about using technology to improve our financial world.

We have a positive, open environment that promotes fresh ideas, challenge and experimentation, and encourages continual learning. We provide flexible working that focusses on delivery rather than just focusing on hours worked.

We’re based in the historic City of Bath, a stone's throw from the train station. (Literally. You could hit it from our office.)

### And the vital statistics?

*	Competitive salary
*	Flexible working arrangements
*	Exposure to the latest technology and an opportunity to help shape the future direction
*	27 days holiday and a day off for your birthday
*	Pension & Life Assurance
