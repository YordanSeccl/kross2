### Who are we?

At Seccl, we’re on a mission to rebuild the infrastructure of investments and advice. We provide the technology that allows people to access financial markets – buying and selling investments, and holding them in tax wrappers like ISAs and pensions.

Our software allows ambitious fintechs to quickly get to market with innovative investment or advice products – and helps financial advisers and investment managers to build stronger, more valuable businesses, by operating their own investment platform.

Ultimately, we want to create a world where everybody can access the financial markets, or find the help they need, more easily and affordably than ever.

We recently became part of the [Octopus Group](https://www.octopusgroup.com/) – an innovative, £9bn+ group of companies that’s on a mission to breathe new life into energy and financial services, and improve the lives of millions of people.

### How can you help?

We’re looking for a versatile, talented writer who can help us to shape how we communicate and bring our brand to life in the written form – by creating a rich suite of great written content. Content that’s clear, engaging, helpful – and that people enjoy and look forward to reading.

### What will you be doing?

**On a day-to-day level, you’ll…**

•	Work with key strategic members of the business to understand our target market (which includes both established investment and advice firms and up-and-coming fintechs) – so that you can create content that speaks to their needs, and with the right voice.

•	Produce regular prospect-facing blog and social media content to support our inbound marketing, as well as recruitment-facing blog/social content to build Seccl’s employer brand

•	Write less regular long-form guides, reports and white papers, to provide the cornerstone content for marketing campaigns

•	Develop persuasive and informative marketing emails that engage prospects, helping to nurture them on the path to purchase

•	Write web copy (and perhaps occasionally support the product team with UX/micro-copy, too) and ad text

•	Help brainstorm new content, new campaigns and new customer experience initiatives that’ll make our audience love us – and support in maintaining an integrated calendar of content across blogs, social and email

Who are we looking for?

We need someone who’s:

•	Creative. You’ll probably be an avid consumer of content – news, social posts, video, whatever – and like producing it. 

•	Able to grasp complex concepts quickly and communicate them simply and clearly – whether in a five-word headline, a research whitepaper or a social media post.

•	Highly organised and able to keep multiple plates spinning. You’ll be ready and eager to crank out varied content at pace.

•	A fast learner who’s curious, eager to try new things and always looking to learn new skills.

•	A doer – someone who can come up with good ideas, then follow them through to completion.

•	Comfortable with ambiguity. A genuine self-starter, you’ll enjoy thinking up and experimenting with new ideas for content. If you want it all on a plate, you’ll be disappointed here…

•	Excited about working in a rapidly growing fintech with a steep learning curve

How do we work?
We’re a team of ambitious, talented, and creative people who are passionate about using technology to improve our financial world.

We have a positive, open environment that promotes fresh ideas, challenge and experimentation, and encourages continual learning. We provide flexible working that focusses on delivery rather than just focusing on hours worked.

We’re based in the historic City of Bath, a stone’s throw from the train station. (Literally. You could hit it from our office.)

And the vital statistics?
•	Competitive salary
•	Flexible working arrangements
•	Exposure to the latest technology and an opportunity to help shape the future direction
•	27 days holiday and a day off for your birthday
•	Pension & Life Assurance
