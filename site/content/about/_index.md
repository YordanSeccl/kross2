  heading: It's bad for business...
  subheading: Many financial advisers and wealth managers are frustrated with the wrap platforms or investment technology that they use. Integration is painful and costly. Admin staff waste time rekeying data between systems. And clients can end up paying for a service that they’re not really happy with.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, young and ambitious fintechs struggle to get to market because of solutions that are expensive to use and difficult to build on.

      heading: And it's bad for people too...
      subheading: Unnecessary admin doesn’t just create a nightmare for administrators. It also makes financial advice more difficult to come by, as advisers are forced to turn away less affluent clients.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the difficulty of launching low-cost investment products means that accessing investments can be more expensive than it needs to be.
