At Seccl, we operate in an exciting domain, where [innovative fintechs](/fintechs) and ambitious, forward-thinking [wealth management firms](/how) collide (in a good way!).

It gives us a unique vantage point from which to assess the [emerging trends](/blog/five-trends) that could define our industry in the future – and also means I'm lucky enough to have some really interesting conversations with some very bright people.

I recently had the pleasure of chatting to the incredibly knowledgeable Heather Hopkins – Founder and Managing Director of consultancy firm, <a href="https://www.nextwealth.co.uk/" target="_blank">NextWealth</a> – as part of their regular <a href="https://audioboom.com/channels/5023280" target="_blank">NextWealth Insights</a> podcast series. You can listen along to it here:

On the agenda? The not-so-small topic of technology in wealth management, and the new future it can help to create for firms and consumers alike. Topics included...

- <strong>The future of advice:</strong> how could advice be delivered in the future – and to whom?

- <strong>Customisation:</strong> what can wealth management learn from other sectors like health and fitness, where personal data can be curated to deliver hyper-customised insights?

- <strong>Trust:</strong> does the ‘trust hurdle’ pose a barrier to innovation of this kind – and when does personalisation become creepy?

- <strong>Collaboration:</strong> how can we encourage firms to co-operate and integrate, and what role can modular architecture can play?

- <strong>Pace of change:</strong> why has the innovation that we’ve seen in other sectors been slower to arrive in wealth management?

It was a fun and far-ranging conversation, and arguably more timely than ever. Over the last few weeks, many advisers will have had to grapple with new tools to make [remote working](/blog/work-from-home-diary-2), well, work. So as we all settle into our (by now probably quite entrenched) new routine, it’s as good a time as any for us all to explore the role that technology can play in supporting the future of our business models – and our broader industry.

Give it a listen and let me know what you think.
