Before Christmas we introduced you to [Raindrop](https://yordanmonev.com/blog/raindrop-pensions-self-employed), one of our newest clients that’s on a mission to help freelancers save for retirement.

A few weeks on and we’re delighted to lift the lid on our work with another hugely exciting business that’s making dramatic waves in the fintech space: [Multiply](https://multiply.ai/).

#### Who are Multiply?

In July 2019, Multiply became [one of the first ](https://www.altfi.com/article/5489_multiply-myeva-vivek-madlani-ceo-digital-independent-financial-adviser-launch)financial advice apps (and the first that’s consumer-facing) to be approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Since then, the team has created plans around more than £1 billion of assets and debt, and made 11,000 individual recommendations – through an impressively simple and easy-to-use mobile app built around an AI-powered chatbot.

Thanks to the app’s slick UX, it takes no time at all to provide a full overview of your financial situation, identify the key goals you’re striving to meet with your money, and get your hands on a financial plan.

Until recently, though, the rest has then been up to you. The app didn’t have the functionality that would allow you to put those recommendations into action then and there – and so users would have had to leave the app and follow the steps on their own.
