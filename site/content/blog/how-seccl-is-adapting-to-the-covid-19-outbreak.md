#### First things first, we want to reassure all of our existing clients and partners that we remain fully operational, with no changes to our day-to-day service.

As you would expect, we will move to a fully remote working model over the next few days.

Because our team already works from across the UK, this is something we’re used to. Our office is in central Bath, but a good number of our team live in London (or elsewhere in the UK). When not commuting to our Bath office, they either work from home or from the main Octopus headquarters in Holborn – and so our team is accustomed to communicating and collaborating remotely.

What's more, our serverless, cloud-based systems architecture and digital, paper-free investment proposition mean that we can operate as normal regardless of whether we're in the office.

With that in mind, as of Thursday 12 March, we have stopped all employee travel from London and asked all employees outside of Bath to work from home.

As of Monday 16 March, we have moved to a reduced team within the office and are now running all key business activities remotely.

To reiterate, this has no impact on our ability to fulfil our day-to-day technology or custodial function: for us, this is business as usual – albeit in a deeply unusual and uneasy context.

If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to get in touch with your normal go-to contact within Seccl – or if you’d like to, you can contact me directly. You can reach me on sam@seccl.tech or 07878 381 579.

Thanks – and take care.

Sam
